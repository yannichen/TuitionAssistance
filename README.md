### Short Description of the Project

For this project, we are going to use the data related to the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) provided by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation. The dataset contains information about TAP award recipients and dollar amounts by the characteristics of recipients, including age, educational background, financial status and more. Using this dataset, we want to figure out how TAP distributes its financial aid, in other words, what features might be important in deciding the qualification of recipient and the dollar amounts given to that recipient.
