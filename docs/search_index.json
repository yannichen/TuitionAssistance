According to IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), for academic year 2021-2022, the average undergraduate tuition &amp; fees for New York Colleges is $9,302 for in-state students and $20,087 for out-of-state students, which is higher than the national average, $6,673 for in-state and $17,800 for out-of-state. Not all families can afford to pay for their tuitions. In order to support those families, state organizations such as the Higher Education Service Corporation was created to centrally administer student financial aid programs, and the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is one of them. Since TAP is New York’s largest student financial aid grant program, we focus solely on this program to get a general picture of how New York State distributes its financial aid. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, we have a better understanding to the distribution of TAP financial aid to New York State residents categorized by different characteristic groups in different years. We believe our findings can help a potential financial aid applicant have a better expectation on how much he or she can get based on their own backgrounds, so that more residents with economic difficulties can have confidence in pursing a higher education. 1.2 Question How does the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) distribute its financial aid? Which feature group, based on both academic and non academic backgrounds, has more recipient? Does being in a specific feature group results in receiving more financial aid? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Education is important. From the society’s perspective, more people attending higher education can create a better workforce that boosts the economy and more educated citizens that together create a better society. From the individual’s perspective, higher education means more opportunity and more knowledge for personal growth. However, not all family can afford the tuition needed, and many may lose the chance due to poverty. In order to support those families, state organization such as the Higher Education Service Corporation was created to centrally administer student financial aid programs, and the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is one of them. So, the question was proposed - How does the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) distribute its financial aid? In other words, we want to investigate the decision making process of the TAP program to see the important features that may affect the disposal of the financial aid and dollar amounts being provided. Speficially, We would like to investigate which feature group, based on both academic and non academic backgrounds, has more recipient and does being in a specific feature group results in receiving more financial aid. 2.2 Data availability The data is from NY Open Data, provided by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation. The original source of the data can be found here: Tuition Assistance Program Dataset We eventually choose this dataset because it focuses on the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which is New York’s largest student financial aid grant program that helps eligible in-state residents pay tuition at approved schools in New York State. The datasets therefore can be representative to investigate the overall distribution of financial aid funds in New York State. This dataset provides insights about TAP award recipients by education level, sector of institution, age, income, and some other characteristics each year beginning from 2000. This dataset will be updated every November. Information contained in this dataset was extracted from the systems that process student application and school certification data as described above and collated by academic year, TAP College Code, school sector, and Federal School Code to facilitate matching with US Department of Education administered loan and grant program data. It is updated in November of each year, coinciding with the publication of the HESC Annual Report. In terms of the quality of the data, the information for the most recent year is estimated, and may be adjusted several years after an academic year has passed. Other than the accuracy, the data is comprehensive and does not contain missing values. The data is available in five formats: CSV, TSV, RDF, XML, RSS. We decided to use the CSV format, and we will directly download the data from the website where the data is updated annually. For additional information and questions, we can contact the database owner directly through the website.

The original source can be found here: Tuition Assistance Program Dataset Information contained in this dataset was extracted from the systems that process student application and school certification data collected by academic year, TAP College Code, school sector, and Federal School Code to facilitate matching with US Department of Education administered loan and grant program data. It is updated every November, coinciding with the publication of the HESC Annual Report. 3.1.2 Data Description In terms of contents, this dataset provides insights about TAP award recipients by education level, sector of institution, age, income, and more in a time range of 20 academic years, from 2000 to 2020. Specifically, the raw data contains 236,475 observations with 16 variables, with details provided below: Academic Year: Academic Year is from July 1 through June 30. Level: U = Undergraduate G = Graduate. TAP Level of Study: Student’s Level of Study: 2 yr Undergrad = Undergraduate 2 Year Program of Study 4 yr Undergrad = Undergraduate 4 Year Program of Study 5 yr Undergrad = Approved Undergraduate 5 Year Program of Study STAP = Supplemental Tuition Assistance Program (authorized additional aid for remedial courses) Grad = Graduate Level Program of Study. Sector Type: Type of Institution is either Public or Private. TAP Sector Group: Sector Group of Institution: 1-CUNY SR = CUNY Senior Colleges 2-CUNY CC = CUNY Community Colleges 3-SUNY SO = SUNY State Operated 4-SUNY CC = SUNY Community Colleges 5-INDEPENDENT = Independent Colleges 6-BUS. DEGREE = Business Degree Granting Institutions 7-BUS. NON-DEG = Non-Degree Business Schools 8-OTHER = All Other Institutions 9-CHAPTER XXII = Chapter XXII TAP Schools. Recipient Age Group: Age of student as of July 1 start of academic year. TAP Financial Status: Financial Status is either Financial_Dependent or Financial_Independent. TAP Award Schedule: There are 3 awards schedules: Dependent Schedule, Independent Schedule, or Married No Dependents Schedule. TAP Degree or NonDegree: Degree = Program of study is classified as degree granting Non Degree = Program of study is classified as non degree. TAP Schedule Letter: Refer to Tuition Assistance Program award schedule documentation. The link is provided in the Additional Resources section after selecting the About tab. Income by $1,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $1,000 income range is the lowest level of granularity that is available in this dataset. Income by $5,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $5,000 income range is the middle level of granularity that is available in this dataset. Income by $10,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $10,000 income range is the highest level of granularity that is available in this dataset. TAP Recipient Headcount: Number of recipients as measured by students receiving at least one term award during the academic year. TAP Recipient FTEs: Number of recipients as measured by academic year Full-Time Equivalents: Full Time Equivalent is a unit that indicates the enrollment of a student in credit-bearing courses in a way that makes it comparable across contexts. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to 1 full-time student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals that a student is enrolled half-time. TAP Recipient Dollars: Total TAP award dollars provided on behalf of TAP recipients attending an Institution. 3.1.3 Data Issue From the descriptions of the 16 variables above, we can see that there are plenty of information regarding the background of an applicant. We also noticed that the TAP Recipient Dollars variable is the Total TAP award dollars, so we need to create two more columns to calculated the average TAP Recipient Dollars based on Recipient Headcount and Recipient FTEs. More details included in the following section. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since the data is available in CSV format, we downloaded it and opened it directly in R. The dataset is correctly formatted, without corrupted or duplicate data. An overview of the dataset before cleaning and transforming is shown below. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 236475 obs. of 16 variables: ## $ Academic.Year : int 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 ... ## $ Level : chr &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; ... ## $ TAP.Level.of.Study : chr &quot;4 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;2 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;4 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;2 yr Undergrad&quot; ... ## $ Sector.Type : chr &quot;PRIVATE&quot; &quot;PRIVATE&quot; &quot;PUBLIC&quot; &quot;PRIVATE&quot; ... ## $ TAP.Sector.Group : chr &quot;5-INDEPENDENT&quot; &quot;6-BUS.

However, we can see that the original dataset only includes the Total TAP award dollars, we needed to transform it into two separate columns indicating the average TAP Recipient Dollars based on Recipient Headcount and Recipient FTEs. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to 1 full-time student. Therefore, the recipient dollars per FTEs provides a standard view of the award for a full-time student. Specifically: Recipient_Dollars_Per_Student = Recipient_Dollars/Recipient_Headcount Recipient_Dollars_Per_Stu_FTEs = Recipient_Dollars/Recipient_FTEs Finally, we convert character variables to factor variables for further analysis. With the columns renamed and rearranged, the dataset is in a good shape for visualization and analysis.

For visualization purposes, the column names are renamed to X1, X2,…,X16, where X15 represents TAP Recipient FTEs. There are only 15 rows that have TAP Level of Study labeled as “Unknown” (which are not considered missing value) and 2 rows that have missing values for TAP Recipient FTEs. Since the number of these incomplete rows is comparatively small to the whole dataset, we simply removed those rows. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Recipient Portrait 4.2 Budget Distribution", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Recipient Portrait To start with, we explore which feature group, based on both academic and non academic backgrounds, has more recipient. 4.1.1 Overall Through data exploration on every single feature (figures not shown), we notice that some of the features in the dataset are very imbalanced. For example, most of the recipients are in undergraduate level compared to graduate level, and most of the recipients are in a degree program compared to a non-degree program. With that, we use heatmap as best practice to plot two or more qualitative features together to see their associations. 4.1.1.1 Income, Age, Sector Type When we filter the data by recipient’s income, age, and sector type, we can see that the largest group is recipients under age 22 attending a public institution with income below $10,000. For both private and public institution, we can see that most of the recipients are under age 22 and has income below $10,000, since the corresponding row and column has the lightest colors, which in this case, the most people. The number of recipients whose age is under 22 decreases as the recipients get more income. The number of recipients whose income is below $10,000 decreases as the recipient’s age gets older. 4.1.1.2 Degree, Level of Study, Award Schedule When we filter the data by recipient’s degree, level of study, and award schedule, which is a reflection of financial status, we can see that the largest group is recipients who are dependent and studying for an undergraduate 4 year degree. The second largest group is recipients who are financial dependent and studying for an undergraduate 2 year degree. There are also few recipients who are financial independent and studying for an undergraduate 2 or 4 year degree. 4.1.2 Transition Through Time Next, we look at the proportion of different categories to see whether there are major changes in recipient distribution through out the years. 4.1.2.1 Level of Study Level of study indicates the kind of program that the recipient is in. For level of study, we can see that the majority of the recipients are 4 year undergraduate students and 2 year undergraduate students. The proportion of 2 year undergraduate students are around 40% and starts to decrease from 2012, while the proportion of 4 year undergraduate students are above 50% and eventually increases to 70%. We also notice that there are very few STAP students, and TAP does not aid graduate student since 2010. Therefore, most of the TAP recipients are undergraduate students, and there is a trend of having more recipients who are considered as 4 year undergraduate students. 4.1.2.2 Sector Group Sector group shows the kind of institution that the recipient is in. For different sector groups, we can see its proportion also shows variations in the past 20 years. Among the 9 different sector groups, independent colleges (5-INDEPENDENT), CUNY Senior Colleges (1-CUNY SR), and SUNY State Operated (3-SUNY SO) are the three major sector groups, each take up about 20% to 30% of the total recipients each year. Specifically, we notice that the proportion of CUNY Senior Colleges (1-CUNY SR) grows larger and larger each year. In 2020, its proportion in sector group is about 25%, which almost doubled its proportion back in 2000, which is about 12%. For independent colleges (5-INDEPENDENT), its proportion decreases in the past 20 years from about 30% to 20%. The proportion for Business Degree Granting Institutions (6-BUS. DEGREE) also decrease. Chapter XXII TAP Schools (9-CHAPTER XXII) are taken into consideration for TAP starting from 2011. Because sector group 1 to 4 are considered as public schools and sector group 5 to 9 are considered as private schools, we can see that overall, in the past 20 years, the proportion of public to private school goes from about 60:40 to 75:25. Therefore, there is a trend of having more recipients who are considered as studying in public institutions. 4.1.2.3 Schedule Letter Schedule letter shows which kind of award schedule is applied for the recipients. For schedule letter, we can see the majority schedule applied is schedule E, which is a schedule for students who are dependent on their parents, or who qualify as an orphan, foster child or ward of the court, or who are financially independent and are married and have tax dependents, or who are financially independent, are single and have tax dependents at Degree-Granting Institutions or Not-For-Profit Registered Business Schools. It is applicable to first-time recipients in the 2000-2001 school year and thereafter. Specifically, recipients who fall in this schedule can get a minimum award of $500 and a maximum award of $5,165 or tuition whichever is less. This type of schedule goes from about 30% in 2000 to over 90% in 2020, and clearly becomes the most popular schedule awarded to TAP recipients. There are also about 5% to 10% of schedule M applied to recipients each year. Schedule M is a schedule for students who are independent and single without dependents at Degree-Granting Institutions or Not-For-Profit Registered Business Schools. It is applicable to first-time recipients in the 1994-95 school year and thereafter, where recipients who fall in this schedule can get a minimum award of $500 and a maximum award of $3,025 or tuition whichever is less. Schedule D takes up the largest proportion in 2000, but its proportion gradually decreases throughout the years, and now it is applied to very few proportion of recipients. Other findings include that schedule U and V are only applied before 2010. 4.2 Budget Distribution After identifying the basic recipient portrait of the Tuition Assistance Program, we turn to analyze the distribution of its grants. In this section, we explore TAP’s grant distribution strategy over the years and the determining factors that influence its amount. 4.2.1 Overall It appears in the histogram that the distribution of the grant amount follows a trimodel. With minor fluctuations on the amount granted based upon individual cases, TAP generally distributes its budgets at about $700, $3,000, and $5,000. 4.2.2 Transition Through Time With the trimodel, we are interested in the grant distribution over years. The ridgeline plot indicates a shift of grants distributing strategy from 2000 to 2020. As time goes by, TAP gives out more awards with relatively high dollar amount. In addition, while the number of low dollar amount awards is decreasing, the amount does not change much. However, awards with large amount are distributed differently. It appears in the graph that in the early years, the dollar amount had many local peaks indicating a focus on evaluating individual cases and the grants being distributed accordingly. However, in recent years, the local peaks disappeared and the distribution started to follow bimodel. Look into two graphs, the middle peak of the trimodel is an indication of strategy for the first ten years, and the last peak of the trimodel is for the second ten years. As we can see, the total grant given by TAP increased from 2000 to 2014 and decreased from 2014 to 2020 with fluctuations. Combining the information in the two graphs below, we find that larger grant amount are granted in recent years with lower total grant amount and fewer recipients. 4.2.3 Determining Factors Finally, we examine the factors that might potentially influence the award received by each recipients. From the Cleveland Dot Plot below, we can see that average grant per FTE given to recipients in private sector are generally higher than that given to recipients in public sector, disregarding which income range the recipient is in. It makes sense since private schools generally require more tuition. We also observe that as the recipient’s income increases, they will generally receive less grants from GAP, though recipients with income between $1 to $5,000 is receiving more grants on average than those who have no income. From the Cleveland Dot Plot below, we can see that for undergraduate program, the longer the program, the more grant a recipient can get. For recipient in a graduate program, the generally receive very low grant. STAP recipient receive grants lower than undergraduate recipients on average. We also notice that there are slight difference in the amount of grant received based on recipient’s age. Recipients under 22 generally receives a lower grant on average than other age recipients except for 5 year undergraduate programs. Recipients over 50 generally receives a low grant on average, exceot for 2 year undergraduate programs.
