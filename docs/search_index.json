According to IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), for academic year 2021-2022, the average undergraduate tuition &amp; fees for New York Colleges is $9,302 for in-state students and $20,087 for out-of-state students, which is higher than the national average, $6,673 for in-state and $17,800 for out-of-state. Not all families can afford to pay for their tuitions. In order to support those families, state organizations such as the Higher Education Service Corporation was created to centrally administer student financial aid programs, and the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is one of them. Since TAP is New York’s largest student financial aid grant program, we focus solely on this program to get a general picture of how New York State distributes its financial aid. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, we have a better understanding to the distribution of TAP financial aid to New York State residents categorized by different characteristic groups in different years. We believe our findings can help a potential financial aid applicant have a better expectation on how much he or she can get based on their own backgrounds, so that more residents with economic difficulties can have confidence in pursing a higher education. 1.2 Question How does the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) distribute its financial aid? Which feature group, based on both academic and non academic backgrounds, has more recipient? Does being in a specific feature group results in receiving more financial aid? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Education is important. From the society’s perspective, more people attending higher education can create a better workforce that boosts the economy and more educated citizens that together create a better society. From the individual’s perspective, higher education means more opportunity and more knowledge for personal growth. However, not all family can afford the tuition needed, and many may lose the chance due to poverty. In order to support those families, state organization such as the Higher Education Service Corporation was created to centrally administer student financial aid programs, and the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is one of them. So, the question was proposed - How does the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) distribute its financial aid? In other words, we want to investigate the decision making process of the TAP program to see the important features that may affect the disposal of the financial aid and dollar amounts being provided. We also would like to check whether there will be changes in distribution or total financial aid amount after the COVID pandemic, specifically in the year 2019 and 2020, as compared to previous years. 2.2 Data availability The data is from NY Open Data, provided by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation. The original source of the data can be found here: Tuition Assistance Program Dataset We eventually choose this dataset because it focuses on the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which is New York’s largest student financial aid grant program that helps eligible in-state residents pay tuition at approved schools in New York State. The datasets therefore can be representative to investigate the overall distribution of financial aid funds in New York State. This dataset provides insights about TAP award recipients by education level, sector of institution, age, income, and some other characteristics each year beginning from 2000. This dataset will be updated every November. Information contained in this dataset was extracted from the systems that process student application and school certification data as described above and collated by academic year, TAP College Code, school sector, and Federal School Code to facilitate matching with US Department of Education administered loan and grant program data. It is updated in November of each year, coinciding with the publication of the HESC Annual Report. In terms of the quality of the data, the information for the most recent year is estimated, and may be adjusted several years after an academic year has passed. Other than the accuracy, the data is comprehensive and does not contain missing values. The data is available in five formats: CSV, TSV, RDF, XML, RSS. We decided to use the CSV format, and we will directly download the data from the website where the data is updated annually. For additional information and questions, we can contact the database owner directly through the website.

The original source can be found here: Tuition Assistance Program Dataset Information contained in this dataset was extracted from the systems that process student application and school certification data collected by academic year, TAP College Code, school sector, and Federal School Code to facilitate matching with US Department of Education administered loan and grant program data. It is updated every November, coinciding with the publication of the HESC Annual Report. 3.1.2 Data Description In terms of contents, this dataset provides insights about TAP award recipients by education level, sector of institution, age, income, and more in a time range of 20 academic years, from 2000 to 2020. Specifically, the raw data contains 236,475 observations with 16 variables, with details provided below: Academic Year: Academic Year is from July 1 through June 30. Level: U = Undergraduate G = Graduate. TAP Level of Study: Student’s Level of Study: 2 yr Undergrad = Undergraduate 2 Year Program of Study 4 yr Undergrad = Undergraduate 4 Year Program of Study 5 yr Undergrad = Approved Undergraduate 5 Year Program of Study STAP = Supplemental Tuition Assistance Program (authorized additional aid for remedial courses) Grad = Graduate Level Program of Study. Sector Type: Type of Institution is either Public or Private. TAP Sector Group: Sector Group of Institution: 1-CUNY SR = CUNY Senior Colleges 2-CUNY CC = CUNY Community Colleges 3-SUNY SO = SUNY State Operated 4-SUNY CC = SUNY Community Colleges 5-INDEPENDENT = Independent Colleges 6-BUS. DEGREE = Business Degree Granting Institutions 7-BUS. NON-DEG = Non-Degree Business Schools 8-OTHER = All Other Institutions 9-CHAPTER XXII = Chapter XXII TAP Schools. Recipient Age Group: Age of student as of July 1 start of academic year. TAP Financial Status: Financial Status is either Financial_Dependent or Financial_Independent. TAP Award Schedule: There are 3 awards schedules: Dependent Schedule, Independent Schedule, or Married No Dependents Schedule. TAP Degree or NonDegree: Degree = Program of study is classified as degree granting Non Degree = Program of study is classified as non degree. TAP Schedule Letter: Refer to Tuition Assistance Program award schedule documentation. The link is provided in the Additional Resources section after selecting the About tab. Income by $1,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $1,000 income range is the lowest level of granularity that is available in this dataset. Income by $5,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $5,000 income range is the middle level of granularity that is available in this dataset. Income by $10,000 Range: When performing data analysis, one of three income ranges can be selected. The $10,000 income range is the highest level of granularity that is available in this dataset. TAP Recipient Headcount: Number of recipients as measured by students receiving at least one term award during the academic year. TAP Recipient FTEs: Number of recipients as measured by academic year Full-Time Equivalents: Full Time Equivalent is a unit that indicates the enrollment of a student in credit-bearing courses in a way that makes it comparable across contexts. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to 1 full-time student, while an FTE of 0.5 signals that a student is enrolled half-time. TAP Recipient Dollars: Total TAP award dollars provided on behalf of TAP recipients attending an Institution. 3.1.3 Data Issue From the descriptions of the 16 variables above, we can see that there are plenty of information regarding the background of an applicant. We also noticed that the TAP Recipient Dollars variable is the Total TAP award dollars, so we need to create two more columns to calculated the average TAP Recipient Dollars based on Recipient Headcount and Recipient FTEs. More details included in the following section. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since the data is available in CSV format, we downloaded it and opened it directly in R. The dataset is correctly formatted, without corrupted or duplicate data. An overview of the dataset before cleaning and transforming is shown below. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 236475 obs. of 16 variables: ## $ Academic.Year : int 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 ... ## $ Level : chr &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;U&quot; ... ## $ TAP.Level.of.Study : chr &quot;4 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;2 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;4 yr Undergrad&quot; &quot;2 yr Undergrad&quot; ... ## $ Sector.Type : chr &quot;PRIVATE&quot; &quot;PRIVATE&quot; &quot;PUBLIC&quot; &quot;PRIVATE&quot; ... ## $ TAP.Sector.Group : chr &quot;5-INDEPENDENT&quot; &quot;6-BUS.

However, we can see that the original dataset only includes the Total TAP award dollars, we needed to transform it into two separate columns indicating the average TAP Recipient Dollars based on Recipient Headcount and Recipient FTEs. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to 1 full-time student. Therefore, the recipient dollars per FTEs provides a standard view of the award for a full-time student. Specifically: Recipient_Dollars_Per_Student = Recipient_Dollars/Recipient_Headcount Recipient_Dollars_Per_Stu_FTEs = Recipient_Dollars/Recipient_FTEs Finally, we convert character variables to factor variables for further analysis. With the columns renamed and rearranged, the dataset is in a good shape for visualization and analysis. An overview of the dataset after transforming is shown below. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 236458 obs. of 18 variables: ## $ Academic_Year : int 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 ... ## $ Level : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;G&quot;,&quot;U&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... ## $ Level_of_Study : Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;2 yr Undergrad&quot;,..: 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 ... ## $ Sector_Type : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;PRIVATE&quot;,&quot;PUBLIC&quot;: 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 ... ## $ Sector_Group : Factor w/ 9 levels &quot;1-CUNY SR&quot;,&quot;2-CUNY CC&quot;,..: 5 6 3 6 1 6 5 7 4 7 ... ## $ Recipient_Age : Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;age 22 - 25&quot;,..: 5 2 5 1 5 2 5 3 1 1 ... ## $ Financial_Status : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Financial_Dependent&quot;,..: 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... ## $ Award_Schedule : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Dependent_Schedule&quot;,..: 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Degree_or_NonDegree : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Degree&quot;,&quot;Non_Degree&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Schedule_Letter : Factor w/ 13 levels &quot;A&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;,..: 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ... ## $ Income_Range_by_1000 : Factor w/ 81 levels &quot;$ 1 to $ 1,000&quot;,..: 28 42 9 54 78 70 6 2 69 15 ... ## $ Income_Range_by_5000 : Factor w/ 17 levels &quot;$ 1 to $ 5,000&quot;,..: 7 10 2 12 17 15 2 1 15 4 ... ## $ Income_Range_by_10000 : Factor w/ 8 levels &quot;$ 0 to $10,000&quot;,..: 3 5 1 6 8 7 1 1 7 2 ... ## $ Recipient_Headcount : int 3 5 1 1 3 1 691 6 1 2 ... ## $ Recipient_FTEs : num 2.037 4.654 1.019 0.517 1.556 ... ## $ Recipient_Dollars : num 6416 5764 2863 259 778 ... ## $ Recipient_Dollars_Per_Student : num 2139 1153 2863 259 259 ... ## $ Recipient_Dollars_Per_Stu_FTEs: num 3150 1239 2810 500 500 ... 3.3 Missing value analysis An Aggregated Missing Patterns Plot is plotted to check for missing values. For visualization purposes, the column names are renamed to X1, X2,…,X16, where X15 represents TAP Recipient FTEs. There are only 15 rows that have TAP Level of Study labeled as “Unknown” (which are not considered missing value) and 2 rows that have missing values for TAP Recipient FTEs. Since the number of these incomplete rows is comparatively small to the whole dataset, we simply removed those rows.
